        <h2>Courgette (Zucchini) and Basil Soup with Aïoli Croutons</h2>
        <p>Courgettes make a fabulous soup, whether in a chunky broth, or a creamy blended one like this recipe here. The aïoli croutons add a lovely punchy crunch to this delicious late summer soup.</p>

        <h2>Tomato, Coconut, and Coriander Soup</h2>
        <p>The fresh acidity of tomatoes adores the smooth silkiness of coconut milk, and for an extra Asian flavour I add lots of chopped fresh coriander. Tinned tomatoes and coconut milk are two of my must-have store-cupboard ingredients. This is a super-speedy soup to make, and happily, it can also be frozen.</p>

        <h2>Potato, Parsley and Thyme Soup with Chorizo</h2>
        <p>A potato soup is so versatile and works superbly with spices, fresh herbs, pestos and drizzles. I prefer to use floury potatoes, rather than waxy, for the lightest, silkiest consistency. If reheating this soup, avoid prolonged simmering, to retain its silky texture. This soup is also delicious unblended and served chunky.</p>
